This R code analyzes the mtcars dataset. It explores the data, checks for missing values, and visualizes the relationship between horsepower (hp) and miles per gallon (mpg) using scatter plots. A linear regression model is fitted to predict mpg from hp, and the model is evaluated using the R-squared value. Finally, the results are visualized with a regression line and a boxplot for mpg, showing a negative relationship between horsepower and fuel efficiency.
